# Ingegneria del Software (Software Engineering)

**Author**: Francesco Ferrillo  
**Year**: University Project  
**Description**: A comprehensive collection of deliverables, diagrams, and documentation developed for the **Software Engineering** course. This project focuses on software analysis, design, and planning methodologies, and is **closely connected** to the implementation contained in the [Web Technologies](https://github.com/FrancescoFerrillo/Tecnologie-Web) repository.

## Overview

This repository contains the **engineering and documentation phase** of a software project developed for the *‚ÄúIngegneria del Software‚Äù* course.  

The work focuses on:
- Gathering and analyzing functional and non-functional requirements  
- Defining system use cases and scenarios  
- Creating UML diagrams (use case, class, sequence, etc.)  
- Planning the architecture and components  
- Producing technical and functional documentation

Unlike a code repository, this project primarily showcases **the methodology and planning** behind software development.

## Technologies & Tools

- **UML** ‚Äî for system modeling and diagramming  
- **Project Management & Software Engineering Methods** ‚Äî requirement analysis, architectural design  
- **PDF / Office Tools** ‚Äî for documentation and reporting  
- (Optionally) modeling tools like StarUML, Draw.io, Lucidchart, etc.

## Features / Contents

Key deliverables included in this project are:

- ‚úÖ Requirements analysis and use case modeling  
- ‚úÖ UML diagrams (use case, class, sequence, activity)  
- ‚úÖ System architecture and component description  
- ‚úÖ Technical specifications for implementation  
- ‚úÖ Final written report

## Connection with the Web Technologies Project

This Software Engineering repository is **conceptually linked** to the [Web Technologies project](https://github.com/FrancescoFerrillo/Tecnologie-Web).  

- üß† **This repository** focuses on *system design, analysis, and documentation*.  
- üíª The **Web Technologies repository** implements the actual **web application**, following the specifications and models defined here.

In short: this project lays the **blueprint**, while the Web Technologies project builds the **real system**.

## Getting Started

To explore this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FrancescoFerrillo/Ingegneria-del-software.git
